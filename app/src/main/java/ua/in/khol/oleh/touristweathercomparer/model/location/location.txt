Knowing the location of the device
Example: A weather app wants to know the deviceâ€™s location.

Use the getLastLocation() method, which returns the most recently available location (which in rare
cases may be null) . This method provides a simple way of getting location and doesn't incur costs
associated with actively requesting location updates. Use in conjunction with the
isLocationAvailable() method, which returns true when the location returned by
getLastLocation() is reasonably up-to-date.
